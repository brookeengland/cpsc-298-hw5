- This article directly looks at whether bias exists in Wikipedia and how it can be measured. Hube (2017) defines bias as any over-representation of one point of view compared to others, which is a violation of the Neutral Point of View policy. The paper identifies four main factors that contribute to bias: language style, editors, cited cources, and gatekeeping/coverage of topics.
For the methodology, Hube (2017) suggests breaking articles down into smaller parts using the revision history. This includes looking at who added or deleted certain text, which sources were cited, and how the language of the text may favor one side. Editors are also profiled by their past contributions to see if they consistently add bias material. Finally, coverage of topics is measured by checking if important perspectives are missing or minimized. Hube then proposes tracking all of these factors over time to see how bias in a Wikipedia article evolves with more edits and editors.

Detecting Biased Statements in Wikipedia

[Google Scholar](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3184558.3191640) | [PDF](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3184558.3191640)

- This article focuses on detecting sentence-level language bias within Wikipedia articles. The method was to build an automatic bias lexicon which contains terms often associated with biased or opinionated writing. This list is then used to check whether sentences contain these words and to measure how strongly those words show up in different contexts. The bias lexicon is then used to train a Random Forest model including additional context such as neighbor words, LIWC features, and POS patterns.

### Sanger, L. (2020)
Wikipedia is Badly Biased

[larrysanger.org](https://larrysanger.org/2020/05/wikipedia-is-badly-biased/)

- Larry Sanger argues that Wikipedia has abandoned its original neutrality policy, now reflecting liberal-left bias in politics, religion, and science. He points out the uneven coverage of political figures, one-sided social issues, and dismissing of particular views in science and religion. Sanger proposes independent, decentralized alternatives to the current structure of Wikipedia such as his Encyclosphere, which is said to ensure genuine neutrality.

Gender gap through time and space: A journey through Wikipedia biographies via the Wikidata Human Gender Indicator

- This article proposes the Wikidata Human Gender Indicator (WHGI), a tool for measuring gender representation in Wikipedia biographies over time, cultures, and languages. It uses data from Wikidata to analyze how gender bias appears in those who are considered "notable" and how these patterns relate to broader issues of gender inequality and human development.

## Democracy in Wikipedia

This study examines whether the Iron Law of Oligarchy exists in Wikipedia by analyzing how a key policy of the website regarding verifiability evolved into its current form.

This study examines how WIkipedia has inspired voluntary associations, collectives & social movemnts to embrace open collaboration as a model of democratic organization. However, many peer prodiction projects such as Wikipedia, might exhibit deep inequalities, suggesting that they may not fufill democratic ideals.
