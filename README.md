## Abstract
Wikipedia has transformed how knowledge is shared and consumed, however, it also raises important questions about
neutrality and bias. This research seeks to investigate how the collaborative nature and openness of Wikipedia reduces
or increases bias compared to traditional encyclopedias. Building upon prior research, some key areas that will be explored 
are the various sources of bias and how we can identify bias at the sentence level and build models to detect biased language.
